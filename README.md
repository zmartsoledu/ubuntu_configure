# ubuntu_configure
Pre and post configuration scripts to generate a preseeded ubuntu image and extend the base system with extra packages afterwards.

The gist of this set of scripts is creating an Ubuntu system with maximum automation, minimum user input and commonly used power-user and developer tools pre-installed, pre-configured. 

If you want finer control over what is installed and how it is configured, you probably are better off configuring your system manually. Also, please bear in mind that the installation doesn't aim to retain any previously installed OS or data, so, if there is any important data on the target installation medium, please take a full backup before starting.

The post-install configuration steps are broken down to functional layers. So, you can either configure a headless Ubuntu server or a full blown desktop environment.

**Currently tested target environments**

*Ubuntu 22.04 LTS*
